AI Voice Sales Agent - Workflow
=============================

1. User opens the web interface (test_voice.html) in their browser.
2. User starts a new call by entering their name and phone number.
3. The frontend sends a POST /start-call request to the FastAPI backend.
4. The backend creates a new conversation and responds with the agent's greeting (text + voice as base64 audio).
5. The frontend displays the agent's message and plays the voice response.
6. User replies by typing a message (or optionally sending voice input).
7. The frontend sends the message to POST /respond/{call_id}.
8. The backend:
   - Updates the conversation history
   - Uses the LLM (DialoGPT-medium) to generate a dynamic, context-aware reply
   - Converts the reply to speech using HuggingFace SpeechT5 (TTS)
   - Returns the reply text and voice (base64 audio)
9. The frontend displays the agent's reply and plays the voice.
10. Steps 6-9 repeat, following the sales flow (introduction, qualification, pitch, objection handling, closing).
11. When the user agrees to enroll or requests the link, the agent thanks them and ends the call.
12. The frontend disables input and shows a "Call ended" message.

All audio is handled in-memory (no files saved). All responses are dynamic and context-aware.
