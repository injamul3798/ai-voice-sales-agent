- **No Audio Files Saved**: All audio is generated and streamed in-memory (base64)

## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

- **Start a call**: The agent greets the customer and introduces the course.
- **Qualification**: Asks about background, goals, and time commitment.
- **Pitch**: Presents the AI Mastery Bootcamp, tailored to user answers.
- **Objection Handling**: Responds to concerns (price, time, etc.).
- **Closing**: Attempts to get a commitment or schedule a follow-up.
- **End**: When the user agrees, the agent thanks them and ends the call.

All agent responses are generated by the LLM and voiced using SpeechT5. No static or hardcoded answers.
